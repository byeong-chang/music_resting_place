Tate McRae - feel like shit,"Usually never cry at all
I would say I'm pretty tough
But it's been a couple weeks now and I still feel stuck in my lungs
And usually I go out on nights
And not think of you once
But if they start playin' that song
I can't help but to think about us, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Really thought I'd be done with the hardest part
When I pulled myself out of your arms
Wish I knew that was only the start
And now I'm fallin' apart 'cause

[Chorus]
Last night for the very first time
You didn't even try to call
Oh I, I, won't lie
I thought I might die
I couldn't even sleep at all
And maybe I'll get used to it (Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah)
But right now I just feel like shit (Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah)
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So I kissed somebody else
Just to see how it felt
But all that was goin' through my brain
Was your hands around my waist
You know how to do it so well

[Pre-Chorus]
Really thought I was done with the hardest part
When I pullеd myself out of your arms
Wish I knew that was only the start
And now I'm fallin' apart 'causе

[Chorus]
Last night for the very first time
You didn't even try to call (Didn't even try to call)
Oh I, I, won't lie
I thought I might die
I couldn't even sleep at all
And maybe I'll get used to it (Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah)
But right now I just feel like shit (Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah)
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Now, if I get a little too drunk, I'll start thinkin', ""What if you were the one?""
I know that the damage is done, done
And I still have the shirt that you wore when we first met
It's there on the floor, I might kick it under the bed
Hopin' that I could forget that

[Chorus]
Last night for the very first time
You didn't even try to call
Oh I, I, won't lie
I thought I might die
I couldn't even sleep at all (At all)
And maybe I'll get used to it (Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah)
But right now I just feel like shit (Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah)
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Used to it
Feel like shit"
Small Talk - Blue,"I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said
I'm a little bit sad about you
I'm a little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
Why I can't talk to you
without hurting on regrets
And lie if you want to
when I ask you if you'd forget
Me and I I keep runnin' from it
And I keep turnin' in bed
But all I picture is
our very first last kiss
And lie if you want to
Like I do when I'm with you
I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said
I'm a little bit sad about you
'Cause you never really asked
why you never really asked why
I don't really wanna dead
that tune when
We're together on a pedestal
And I never really said the truth
I'm a little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
Tears should be flowin'
But I would rather
play pretend yeah
Some call it hopeless
I call it Better being friends
You and I
I see no turnin' back
And I keep tryna relax
But all I picture is
our very first last kiss
Lie if you need to
Like I do when I'm with you
I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said
I'm a little bit sad about you
'Cause you never really asked
why you never really asked why
I don't really wanna dead
that tune when
We're together on a pedestal
And I never really said the truth
I'm a little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
Tell me what's on my mind
Tell me that no you're fine
Tell me what's on my mind
We're together on a pedestal
Tell me that No you're fine
I'm a little bit sad why I
never really said I'm
I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said
I'm a little bit sad about you
'Cause you never really asked
why you never really asked why
I don't really wanna dead
that tune when
We're together on a pedestal
And I never really said the truth
I'm a little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue
A little bit sad
why I never really said I'm blue"

Lauv - Sims (Edited Ver.),"I wish that you
and I lived in the Sims
We could build a house
And plant some flowers
and have kids
We're both at some trashy
Halloween party downtown
And I'll probably
never see you again
I wish that we met on a VHS
I'd erase the things I said
And that I'll probably say again
Hit rewind on all the times
I got lost in my head
But I guess I'll never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
Oh goddamn
I wish we would have met
On another night baby
Maybe then
I wouldn't have let you leave me
Yeah oh goddamn
I wish we would have met
On another night baby
In another life baby
In another life
I wish that we met
walkin' round the moon
And I'd say nice to meet you
'Stead of saying nice to know you
I tried to impress you
With some bullshit
'bout my name
At least I wouldn't be
too drunk to stay
I wouldn't have let you slip away
Oh goddamn
I wish we would have met
On another night baby
Maybe then
I wouldn't have let you leave me
Yeah oh goddamn
I wish we would have met
On another night baby
In another life baby
In another life
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let
I wouldn't have let you

Mokita - More Than Friends,"Like a red light on the interstate
Hate that I made us slow down so fast
Like an L.A. club without the wait
You just can't make sense of where we’re at

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could have said what I'm saying now
Should have played it first, but for what it's worth

[Chorus]
I’m sorry that I let us down again
I never meant to break your heart
Tear us apart like this
Oh, I just wish that I could go
Back to back then
Back when we were more than friends

[Post-Chorus]
More than friends

[Verse 2]
Now we pause at the end of phone calls
'Cause neither of us knows how to say goodbye
Tell our friends we're better off
But everything I feel says that's a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could have said what I'm saying now
Should have played it first, but for what it's worth

[Chorus]
I'm sorry that I let us down again
I never meant to break your heart
Tear us apart like this
Oh, I just wish that I could go
Back to back then
Back when we were more than friends

[Post-Chorus]
Back when we were more than friends
Back when we were more than friends

[Bridge]
Oh baby, I can't help it
I want more than friends

Oh baby, I can’t help it
I want more than friends
Oh baby, I can’t help it
I want more than friends"
Pinkish Blu - Red Hot Moon,"It's all
In that very moment
Your sound
Crawled up into my skin
Like the call from the wild
I've been divided
And it's all
In that very moment

Chorus
I'm thinking oh my god
You're all I'll ever want
But you're the red hot moon
And?I'm?a?waterfront

Verse 1
You sat down?on the stairs?and I sat down short of breath
The clouds blocked out the sun and I heard your little hum
I stopped to think this over but you looked into the light
Like we were in it, we were there
And my eyes drew to the right

I felt my fingers warmer as your head lay on my shoulder
The wind picked up a little bit, I couldn't hear you whispering
A silence fell on us and we know what happened next, we were in it, we were there and your eyes drew to the left

Chorus
I'm thinking oh my god
You're all I'll ever want
But you're the red hot moon
And I'm a waterfront

Bridge
It's all
In that very moment
Your sound
Crawled up into my skin

Chorus
I'm thinking oh my god
You're all I'll ever want
But you're the red hot moon
And I'm a waterfront"
"3Lau, Justin Caruso  - Better With You (feat. Iselin)","Last night I was messed up
but I hope you will forget
Please do me a favor
erase the things I said
Pull me a little closer
take away the pain
Remind me
I got everything to lose
I'm better with you
I’m better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I’m better with you
I'm better with you
Laying by your bedside
you feel so far away
Guess my quota is full now
go ahead make a mistake
You'll say that you're sorry
and I'll say it's ok
Cause I know
I got everything to lose
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
You’ll say that you’re sorry
and I'll say it’s ok
Cause I know
I got everything to lose
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I’m better with you
I am by your side
nothing else will matter
When your eyes meet mine
we say it all in silence
Under the same sky
good things fall together
Now I know I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you"
keshi - summer,"Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don't touch lips, not an issue
I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don't touch lips, not an issue
I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to

One time, maybe twice in
One night, it's alright we're
Both alone so go together
Kiss my wounds but not forever
Fuck around, feel my heartbeat
Fallin' down in the backseat
Fill me up 'cause I'm runnin' on empty
And it's fine if we're only pretending

Three months is all we got
Try not to fall in love
Don't think I've had enough but I said it's fine by me

I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else

Said we goin' bye bye in a minute
I'ma chill on the Southside, caught feelings
When the leaves turn, no more favors
Nice to meet ya, catch you later, yeah

Bazzi - Beautiful (Feat. Camila Cabello),"Hey
Beautiful beautiful

But nothing can compare to
when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some
Henny got you faded
You're saying you're the one for me

The Story Never Ends,"Stick stick to your stones
cause that's all you know
I was caught in the middle
I swallow my words
down to the bone
Cause nothing's that simple
Late at night you pour it out
Know that only brings you down
But go ahead give me
all the blame
Twist my words and
set them to flame woah
We all know
That you'll go tell
all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you
never met
And woah
We all know
The story never ends ends
The story never ends ends
Wound me like a toy
spinning too fast
In every direction
How how could I stay
when you lit a match
to all my intentions
Late at night you pour it out
Know that only brings you down
But go ahead give me
all the blame
Twist my words and
set them to flame woah
We all know
That you'll go tell
all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish
you never met
And woah
We all know
The story never ends ends
The story never ends ends
That’s who you are
Crash the car
And blame the road
Never your fault
After all
I would know
The story never ends
The story
The story never ends ends
The story never ends ends
The story
The story
The story
The story"
Sam Smith - Make It To Me,"My mind runs away to you
With the thought I hope you'll see
Can't see where it's wandered to
But I know where it wants to be
I'm waiting patiently
though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
and I wanted you to know that
You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there we're meant to be
So keep your head down and make it to me
And make it to me
So sick of this lonely air
It seems such a waste of breath
So much that I need to say
So much to get off my chest
I'm waiting patiently
though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
and I wanted you to know that
You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there we're meant to be
So keep your head down and make it to me
Make it to me
Make it to me
Make it to me"
J.Fla - Shape Of You,"The club isn't the best
place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends
at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a
conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop
put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
and now I'm singing like
Do you know I want your love
Your love was handmade
for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don't mind me
Say boy let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and
put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering
something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering
something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours
about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
Leave and get in a taxi
then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like
Do you know I want your love
Your love was handmade
for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don't mind me
Say boy let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and
put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

Slow dance these summer nights
Our disco ball's my kitchen light

And you need to know
That nobody could take your place, your place
And you need to know
That I'm hella obsessed with your face, your face

Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad, so bad, oh

And you need to know
You're the only one alright, alright
And you need to know
That you keep me up all night, all night

Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad, so bad, oh
So bad, oh
Oh, my heart hurts
Oh, my heart hurts
Oh, my heart hurts
So bad, oh"
Dan + Shay - Speechless,"You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

Pre-Chorus
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

Chorus
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

Verse 2
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

Chorus
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

Bridge
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

Chorus
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

Outro
Oh, you know it, baby"
"Dan + Shay, Justin Bieber - 10,000 Hours","Do you love the rain
does it make you dance
When you're drunk
with your friends at a party
What's your favorite song
does it make you smile
Do you think of me
When you close your eyes tell me
what are you dreamin'
Everything I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours
and ten thousand more
Oh if that's what it takes
to learn
that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there
but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours
or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Do you miss the road
that you grew up on
Did you get your middle name
from your grandma
When you think
about your forever now
do you think of me
When you close your eyes tell me
what are you dreamin'
Everything I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours
and ten thousand more
Oh if that's what it takes to
learn
that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there
but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours
or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm gonna love you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh want the good and the bad
and everything in between
Ooh gotta cure my curiosity
Ooh yeah
I'd spend ten thousand hours
and ten thousand more
Oh if that's what it takes to
learn
that sweet heart of yours
Sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there

JAX - Like My Father,"I wanna come home to roses
And dirty little notes on Post-its
And when my hair
starts turning gray
He'll say I'm like a fine wine
better with age
I guess I learned it
from my parents
That true love starts
with friendship
A kiss on the forehead
a date night
Faking apology after a fight
I need a man
who's patient and kind
Gets out of the car
and holds the door
I wanna slow dance
in the living room like
We're eighteen
at senior prom and go
Old with someone
who makes me feel young
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom
I want a road trip in the summers
I wanna make fun of each other
I wanna rock out to Billy Joel
And flip our kids off
when they call us old
He'll accidentally burn our dinner
And let me be the scrabble winner
And when my body changes shapes
He'll say Oh my God
you look hot today
I need a man
who's patient and kind
Gets out of the car
and holds the door
I wanna slow dance
in the living room like
We're eighteen
at senior prom and go
Old with someone
who makes me feel young
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom
And if he lives up to my father
Maybe he could teach our daughter
What it takes to love a queen
She should know she's royalty
I need a man
who's patient and kind
Gets out of the car
and holds the door
I wanna slow dance
in the living room like
We're eighteen
at senior prom and go
Old with someone
who makes me feel young
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom"
